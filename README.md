# Digital Object Manager

We don't maintain this plugin anymore. The functionality formerly associated with it can now be found in the [ao_mods](https://github.com/duspeccoll/ao_mods) (for exporting MODS representations of Archival Objects) and [item_linker](https://github.com/duspeccoll/item_linker) (for linking Archival Objects to Digital Object records for their surrogates) plugins.

If you have questions about this plugin, they may be directed to kevin.clair [at] du.edu.
